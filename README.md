# taperofpaper.github.io

Welcome to my website! It's far from complete, but that's ok.

Lists my skills and experience.

Adapated from a template so I can learn how websites work.

# TODO
- Add the libraries/frameworks/tools I've used
- Add a cool novelty to the beginning to make it stand out
- Fix icon obfuscation when its being hovered over; it should NOT be obfuscated!
- Add executive summary

# Tools
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
